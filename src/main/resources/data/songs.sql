        'A single by HeeJin, the first member of Girls of the Month. Loona, who have drawn attention in media as a massive-scale girl group even before debut, has been unveiled with the reveal of its first member HeeJin. Loona will reveal a new member every month starting in October 2016, over a time period of over a year. Each month, the girl of the month will release a single and music video that can show off her skills and character. For the first member HeeJin, the production team MonoTree completed the track and director Jo Boem-jin and VM Project produced the music video of "ViViD" original version. "ViViD" is a colorful-feeling lo-fi track, which shows off Heejin''s character with clarity. It tells a story of meeting a person to love in a repetitive and colorless routine, and only then finding a vivid color within oneself. On the other hand, the acoustic mix of "ViViD" changes the original into a groovy guitar-based track, with HeeJin''s delicate sense of rhythm being a pleasure. The acoustic version''s music video was filmed in Paris by VAM Production.'

        'While HeeJin, HyunJin, HaSeul, YeoJin, and ViVi have released their solo singles each month to build up the true form as LOOΠΔ, ''Love & Live'' and ''Love & Evil'' were the first real steps towards the ''Loonaverse'', the alternate universe LOOΠΔ lives in. It isn''t just a series of releases every month to make a group in a year, but it is a story told by music introduced to the world, one after another, to expand the Loonaverse. As previously announced, the girl of May has arrived. Kim Lip is a 19 year old girl who starts to draw a new circle, different from the one drawn by the previous members. While we traveled around the world going to places such as France, Japan, Iceland, England, Taiwan, New Zealand, Hong Kong, and Busan to witness the LOOΠΔ episodes according to locations, the new circle will evolve around three different colors. Kim Lip, representing the color red, will gather two other girls to add to the palette of the circle. As Kim Lip changes up the way the circle is drawn, the style of music they bring to the game moves forward as well. The title track, ''Eclipse'' is an urban R&B track produced by Daniel Obi Klein, the producer of E-Sens'' critically acclaimed album ''The Anecdote''. While LOOΠΔ 1/3 has asked questions about love, the sweetness, the pain, the joy, the worries, and hidden emotions, Kim Lip tells without any hesitation that "love just happens like it''s destined to," in the lyrics. "Even the moonlight feels like you," she says in the supporting track ''Twilight'', singing through a sleepless night towards the moon. Cha Cha Malone, the producer of AOMG wrote the song for Kim Lip, adding a deeper tint to Kim Lip''s color red. Kim Lip is a fresh start for LOOΠΔ''s expansion of their universe. A new unit will be formed along with the girl of June and the girl of July to present a whole new color, different from LOOΠΔ 1/3. The new unit and LOOΠΔ 1/3 will co-exist and unify in Loonaverse, and when other members scattered around the world unite to create a bigger circle as a whole, the construction of the moon LOOΠΔ has been dreaming about will be complete. Can JinSoul, rescued from a basement in Hong Kong by the wishes of the fans, meet with the rest of the LOOΠΔ? Will YeoJin find her way towards the other members without wandering off somewhere else? Who will Kim Lip meet to complete her circle of colors? With the introduction of Kim Lip, LOOΠΔ eclipses.'

HaSeul, who always seems to cause rain wherever she goes, and the youngest member YeoJin, who hops around everywhere like a noisy frog joined along. An android from Hong Kong, ViVi was introduced to complete LOOΠΔ''s first milestone, LOOΠΔ 1/3. As they pass through the endless forest created with ''Love&Live'' and ''Love&Evil'', LOOΠΔ''s universe kept on expanding. Each girl meets another girl like building ''blocks'' stacking, and the encounters of each girl creates new synergies to bear ''berries''. The structure built by these young innocent girls eclipsed with Kim Lip''s appearance to show a different side of what they had built. Now, the introduction of a new girl draws a even bigger circle now. JinSoul is the girl of this month. JinSoul had caught the eyes of the fans first with ViVi''s help during their encounter in Hong Kong. She finally joins LOOΠΔ with her new single, ''Singing in the Rain''. Dressed in a blue school uniform, she brings a future bass track, ''Singing in the Rain'' to show her colors to the fullest. The track fires up speakers with its accelerating tempo like a pulsating heart in excitement. The title of the supporting track ''Love Letter'' performed by JinSoul and Kim Lip sounds like a ballad number, but it actually is a track full of groove, created from the clash of the two girls with their unique and distinct styles. Now with its progress just over half way, the universe of LOOΠΔ strengthens more and more to show its real potential. Kim Lip, JinSoul, and the next girl to come will form a new unit to add colors very different from what LOOΠΔ 1/3 has brought.'

In the process, LOOΠΔ / ODD EYE CIRCLE has placed themselves among the names in the iTunes charts worldwide, and in the Billboard top world albums chart, mix and matching to write their own organic story. Now, LOOΠΔ takes another step with the introduction of Yves to start building its last four-member squad. Yves asks a question in Eden. “Is it really a bad thing to disobey God?” If someone has already decided our fate, wouldn’t it be a better life to stand up and against that fate? Even if it’s not something grand such as God or fate, Yves sings that she will not surrender herself to any walls or glass ceilings she may have to face. The title track “new” is a song where Yves declares that she will be herself no matter what kind of hardships, pain, and frustration faces her. It is the first track released in the genre of Soultronica in Korea, with Yves’ confident voice laid on top of bold beats to prove LOOΠΔ’s new concept and quality. The music video for “new” was directed by DigiPedi. He captures fatal images of Yves, who takes a bite of the apple on purpose to be exiled to the earth. The supporting track “D-1” is a French-pop style track with trivial emotions and stories of a girl told in a classy way. Just as ‘Love & Live’, ‘Love & Evil’, ‘Mix & Match’, and ‘Max & Match’ have, LOOΠΔ shuffles and swaps words to toughen its Mobius strip to become one.'

The music video has references to historical and fictional figures such as the artist Rene Magritte, Hans Christian Andersen’s short story “The Little Match Girl”, and John Appleby’s novel “Aphrodite Means Death”. The supporting track “Girl’s Talk” is a duet by Chuu and Yves, a rendition of a daily dialogue between two girls. Sweet but sometimes secretive, the precious chats between the girls get reinterpreted to become a song. G-High of Monotree, who has produced HeeJin’s “ViViD” and LOOΠΔ / ODD EYE CIRCLE’s “Uncover”, crafts the track to perfection to prove the quality.

With the largest scale and the longest period of debut promotion in the K-pop history, LOOΠΔ has been building its own universe carefully to build credibility in the quality of music and the trust in the team among fans. LOOΠΔ 1/3 has gone around the world to unite the girls, and released ''Love&Live'' and ''Love&Evil'' to show the process of transformation to explain the universe of LOOΠΔ for the first time. LOOΠΔ / ODD EYE CIRCLE gathered three odd girls to complete a big circle with colors as the central idea. Last four girls are remaining. Starting with Yves, Chuu and Go Won talk about their ego. The ego is seen as a girl who admires someone, or envies another. Sometimes, it starts from self-loathing or disappointment in oneself. However, they come to a realization that self-awareness is not decided upon or created by somebody else, but build by oneself by starting to love oneself. With novelty, excitement, and uniqueness. Although it may seem selfish, the process of completing one''s ego with loving oneself is captured in the story. Olivia Hye''s titled track ''Egoist’ starts with calm melodies to eventually encounter provocative beats to take a step towards loving oneself instead of someone else. Pop melodies mix with EDM beats to build up until a dramatic fall at the beat drop, which then is brought to salvation by JinSoul''s rap. Also, the music video features Olivia Hye''s dynamic movements, along with hidden cuts around the narratives of LOOΠΔ. Go Won and Olivia Hye''s duet ''Rosy'' captures the pretty but edgy unpredictable emotions of modern girls who are nice but chic, kind but naughty, or interested but not enough to go out with someone. After the introduction of its twelfth member Olivia Hye, LOOΠΔ will spend April as the preparation period until the new unit will be unveiled in May. There will also be an event in May with a whole new concept announced for the fans. '
